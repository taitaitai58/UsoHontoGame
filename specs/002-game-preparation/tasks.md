# Implementation Tasks: Game Preparation for Moderators

**Feature**: 002-game-preparation
**Branch**: `002-game-preparation`
**Generated**: 2025-11-10
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-10 (refined based on cross-artifact analysis)
**Total Tasks**: 89

## Overview

This document provides a complete, dependency-ordered task list for implementing the game preparation feature. Tasks are organized by user story (US1-US6) to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript 5, Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma 6, Zod 3, SQLite, Vitest, Playwright

**Analytics-Driven Improvements**: This task list has been refined based on cross-artifact analysis to address:
- Episode text validation (1-1000 chars) emphasized as CRITICAL requirement
- "Complete presenter" definition clarified (exactly 3 episodes AND exactly 1 lie)
- Presenter nickname lookup error handling explicitly included
- Test coverage enhanced for edge cases and error scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope** (Recommended First Milestone):
- ✅ User Story 1 (P1): Create New Game
- Delivers immediate value: Moderators can create and persist games
- Independent test: Create game → verify in database → verify in game list

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. **Sprint 1** (MVP): US1 - Game creation foundation
2. **Sprint 2**: US2 + US3 - Content creation (presenters/episodes) + status management
3. **Sprint 3**: US4 + US5 + US6 - Game management (list, edit, delete)

## Task Legend

- `[P]` = Parallelizable (can run simultaneously with other [P] tasks in same phase)
- `[US#]` = User Story number (US1-US6)
- Task IDs are in recommended execution order (T001-T089)

## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3+ (User Stories)

User Story Dependencies:
- US1 (Create Game) ........................... No dependencies [MVP]
- US2 (Presenters/Episodes) ................... Requires US1
- US3 (Status Management) ..................... Requires US1, US2
- US4 (Game List) ............................. Requires US1
- US5 (Edit Game) ............................. Requires US1, US2, US4
- US6 (Delete Game) ........................... Requires US1, US4
```

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Setup)
- T007-T012: All Zod schema creation tasks can run in parallel

### Phase 2 (Foundational)
- T014-T015: Domain errors can run in parallel
- T016-T017: Value objects can run in parallel
- T018-T019: Value object tests can run in parallel
- T023-T025: Entity tests can run in parallel after entities created
- T030-T031: Repository tests can run in parallel

### User Story Phases
- Within each user story phase, test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other [P] tasks
- Example US2: T047-T048 (use case tests) can run in parallel

## Testing Strategy

**Test-Driven Development** (per Constitution Principle IV):
1. Write tests first for each component (marked as [P] tasks)
2. Implement to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests: Domain entities, value objects, use cases, Zod schemas
- Integration tests: Repositories (Prisma + InMemory)
- E2E tests: Complete user flows for each user story

**Independent Test Criteria** (per user story):
- Each user story has defined acceptance scenarios
- Each user story delivers testable, incremental value
- Tests can run independently without blocking other stories

## Implementation Notes

1. **Zod Validation Pattern**: All Server Actions validate input with Zod before calling use cases
2. **Repository Pattern**: Use dependency injection to swap InMemory/Prisma repos
3. **Lie Marker Security**: Never expose `isLie` field in public DTOs (FR-006)
4. **Status Transitions**: Enforce business rules in Game entity methods
5. **Custom Hooks**: Extract all form logic from components (Constitution Principle III)
6. **Server Components First**: Default to Server Components, Client only for interactivity
7. **Episode Text Validation**: 1-1000 character limit is a CRITICAL requirement, not an assumption - validate in Zod schema and test edge cases
8. **Presenter Nickname Lookup**: Validate nickname exists in session system before adding presenter, throw NotFoundError for invalid nicknames
9. **Complete Presenter Definition**: Exactly 3 episodes AND exactly 1 lie marker - validate before status transition to 出題中
10. **Concurrent Edits**: Last-write-wins strategy (no optimistic locking in MVP) - document for future enhancement

## Next Steps

1. **Start with MVP**: Implement US1 (T001-T039) for first working version
2. **Add Content**: Implement US2 and US3 (T040-T066) for playable games
3. **Complete Management**: Implement US4-US6 (T067-T087) for full feature
4. **Polish**: Implement Phase 9 (T088-T089) for UI consistency

**Total Tasks**: 89 (Setup: 13, Foundational: 18, US1: 8, US2: 18, US3: 9, US4: 9, US5: 7, US6: 5, Polish: 2)
